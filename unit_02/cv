        <p>That is me</p>
        
        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p> I'm a student from Denmark on exchange at Universityof Dundee. I'm currently studying for Roskilde University, also known as RUC. In the past I've studied in Sweden, but that was in my younger days. I have small experience with coding in different languages, such as Python and Java, due to project. I would say I have decent experience with those languages, but also HTML and CSS, but it's mostly self taught, since the group project for RUC was to design a job application website.</p>
